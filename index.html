		<p class='home'><em>Digital Divination</em> is a project-based making and exploratory seminar-style course that examines and plays with the relationship between <span class='one'>technology</span> and <span class='two'>ritual</span>.  It introduces histories and current ways technological artifacts serve or carry value as talismans, particularly in non-western and post-colonial contexts, and furthermore, how rituals themselves can be seen as forms of computation in their ability to transmit information and create and/or maintain networks.  Class members will also explore their own relationship to the tools they use in cultural and daily practices.  Through building on discussions and technical workshops in physical computing/internet-of-things (IOT) (with Arduino) and machine learning (python-based libraries/tools such as Tensorflow and OpenCV), students will produce their own rituals (either movement-based/gestural, or object-based) in order to engage with critical questions around the intersection of rituals and technology.</p>
